# C, Debugging

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering Studies** at **ALX School** . It aims to learn about debugging ,methods of debugging manually and how to read error messages in **C language**


# Technologies

* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS


## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C


| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |

| 0-main.c, main.h |In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project |
| 1-main.c | Donâ€™t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task |
| 2-largest_number.c, main.h | This program prints the largest of three integers |
| -print_remaining_days.c, main.h | This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration |
